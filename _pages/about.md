My academic journey in computational chemistry and materials science began at Nanjing University, where I completed my Bachelor's degree, followed by a Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry from the University of Chicago. During my doctoral studies, I specialized in the GW approximation and electron-phonon interaction. Since 2022, I have been applying this expertise at Microsoft Research AI for Science, where I bridge the domains of computational materials science and artificial intelligence to advance materials discovery.

My current research focuses on developing artificial intelligence approaches to accelerate materials design. A key component of this work involves [MatterSim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04967), a multi-modal materials science foundation model that integrates diverse materials data representations. Through this project, we aim to enhance our fundamental understanding of materials while expediting their discovery and optimization.

My research trajectory reflects my commitment to advancing computational methods in chemistry and materials science. By combining rigorous theoretical training with cutting-edge AI techniques, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible in materials design and simulation.

Our team at Microsoft Research AI for Science is actively expanding its research frontiers. We welcome talented researchers to join us as full-time scientists or research interns, and we actively pursue academic collaborations worldwide.
